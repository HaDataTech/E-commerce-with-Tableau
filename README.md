# E-commerce with Tableau
## Problem Statment
E-commerce companies offer vast product choices by storing large inventories. These include fast- and slow-moving items, each incurring space and maintenance costs. To minimize expenses, strategic inventory planning is essential. Efficient management helps balance customer demand with operational costs, ensuring profitability and sustainability in a competitive market. <br/>
Identify top revenue-generating products and apply market basket analysis to predict individual customer purchase behaviorâ€”estimating which items are likely bought alone or alongside others with reasonable certainty.
## Project pipeline
**Data exploration and cleaning**: Identify missing and duplicate values in each column and treat them accordingly. Also, treat any and all data quality issues associated with the dataset.<br/>
**Data visualisation**: Create appropriate visualisations to identify the most ordered products by quantity and revenue.<br/>
**Market basket analysis**: Identify combinations of product categories that are ordered frequently and visualise them as required. This can be done by creating a simple matrix with product categories in the rows and columns and then checking which of the pairs show associations.<br/>
**Dashboarding and Presentation**: Create a neat dashboard containing the important visualisations and supplement it with an executive summary containing valuable insights and recommended steps of action.
